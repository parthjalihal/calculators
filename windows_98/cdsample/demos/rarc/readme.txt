------
SOUND
------
The Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version captures Pac-Man's 
original sounds, enhancing your playing experience. 

The Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version uses DirectSound, 
which supports the following sound cards:
- Sound Blaster:  8-bit cards, 16-bit cards, and the AWE32.
- ESS: 488, 688, 1488, 1688.
- MediaVision: PAS 16, PAS Studio, PAS Plus, Pro 3D, and Blue 
  Lite Special.
- Aztech: Nova 16, Washington 16, Rocky 2.
- Microsoft: Windows Sound System.

If your sound card is not listed above, you might experience sound 
delays while playing the game. 

The Adlib Gold 1000 sound card is not supported. While sound will work, 
performance may be poor.

Faults have also been encountered in certain situations on the Roland 
Rap 10 and the Gravis UltraSound MAX sound cards.

To turn the sound on or off, click Sound on the Options menu. When 
the game sounds are turned on, a check mark is displayed next to the 
command name.

-------------
VIDEO DISPLAY
-------------
The Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version requires a Super VGA 
video card set to at least 256 Color.

------------------------------------------------------
GAME PERFORMANCE: How to Get the Fastest Screen Action
------------------------------------------------------
Here are some tips for maximizing the speed of the game action:

Decreasing the size of the game window increases the speed of game 
changes seen on the screen. The larger the window, the more your 
computer must work to update the game screen. The game window is 
resized by clicking the mouse on the lower right corner, and holding 
the mouse button down while moving the pointer toward the upper left 
of the screen. Please note that the game must be paused before the 
window can be resized. 

Decreasing the number of colors used for your video display can 
increase performance. You must use a setting of at least 256 Color 
(8 bit). Depending upon your computer, this minimal setting may offer 
higher performance than settings of High Color (16 bit) or True Color 
(24 bit). To select a color setting, click the Start button, then 
point to Settings. Point to Control Panel, then click the Display 
icon. Click the Settings tab in the Display Properties dialog box, 
and choose a new color palette setting. 

Turning off sound, which is done from the game's Options menu, can also
increase screen performance. 

If you are using the Aztech Sound Galaxy Washington PCI sound card 
and are experiencing performance problems, try disabling your joystick 
control.


---------------------------------
SOME GENERAL NOTES
---------------------------------
The Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version was designed for 
Windows 95 (and later) operating systems. Setup will not install onto 
Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11, or Windows 3.1 and 3.11. 

If you do not have a sound card or if your sound card is not working, 
your joystick will not operate. 

When the Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version is running, sounds 
from other applications will not be played. For example, if you have 
an e-mail program that chimes upon receipt of a new message, the chime 
will not be heard, even if your game is paused and minimized. 

Screen savers will not activate while the Microsoft Return of Arcade 
Trial Version is running, even if your game is paused or minimized.

Do not attempt to run the retail version of Microsoft Return of Arcade and
the Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version at the same time.

Our faithful reproduction of classic games is so complete that we 
purposely included the idiosyncrasies of the originals. For example, 
the Customize Game dialog box in Pac-Man allows you to set the number 
of lives a player is given for three or five, but there is no setting 
for four lives. This is because such a setting wasn't allowed by the 
DIP switches on the original arcade game. Likewise, eating a flashing 
ghost at just the right moment as it exits the starting cage causes 
the eyes to float around the maze, rather than return to the cage. 

-------------------------------
THE BOSS KEY LIVES!
-------------------------------
As with Microsoft Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade and the
Microsoft Return of Arcade Trial Version have the same great "boss key" 
that makes the game disappear should the need arise to look busy. Just 
press the Escape key and your game will immediately pause and minimize 
-- becoming a mere taskbar button along the bottom of your work-filled 
desktop. A click of the game's taskbar button returns you to exactly 
where you left off.
