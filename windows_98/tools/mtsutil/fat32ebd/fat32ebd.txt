=============
INTRODUCTION
=============

The FAT32 Emergency Boot Disk (EBD) provides a virus-free means for
starting and troubleshooting a computer, as well as a means for
partitioning large drives with the FAT32 file system.

The utility that creates the EBD, FAT32EBD.EXE, writes an image of a
known-good boot sector that was scanned for viruses. A virus-free
boot disk can be used to troubleshoot systems that you suspect are
infected with a virus, or to create a large partition for Windows 98.


=========================================
HOW TO CREATE A FAT32 EMERGENCY BOOT DISK
=========================================

The utility that creates the FAT32 EBD, FAT32EBD.EXE, can be run from
MS-DOS or within Windows. It will prompt you to insert a 1.44 MB
floppy disk in the A:\ drive and then prompt you to continue.
FAT32EBD.EXE transfers the boot sector to the floppy to ensure
there are no viruses. Next, the files for the disk are extracted from
the WIN98*.CAB files and transferred to the floppy.

------------
Requirements
------------

 - Access to the Windows 98 CD-ROM
 - Access to a 1.44 MB floppy drive on A:\
 - 1.44 MB floppy disk

-----------------------------------------------------------
Steps to create the FAT32 EBD using Windows 95 or Windows98
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Start button and select Windows Explorer from the
   Programs menu.

2. Select the CD-ROM drive containing the Windows 98 CD-ROM.

3. Select and double-click the \Tools folder to expand it. Expand the
   subdirectory, \MTSutil, and then its subdirectory, \FAT32EBD. 
 
4. Double-click FAT32EBD.EXE and follow its prompts to create a FAT32
   EBD.

5. Write-protect the diskette when it is finished creating the EBD to
   ensure a virus cannot write to the disk.

6. Restart the computer with the FAT32 EBD.

-----------------------------------------------
Steps to create the FAT32 EBD using Windows 3.x
-----------------------------------------------

For the best results, exit Windows and create the FAT32 EBD using
MS-DOS. Please refer to the following section after you exit Windows.

------------------------------------------
Steps to create the FAT32 EBD using MS-DOS
------------------------------------------

1. At a command prompt outside of Windows, change to the CD-ROM drive
   containing the Windows 98 CD-ROM. For example, if your CD-ROM
   drive is D:\, you would type: 

	D:\    [press Enter key]

2. Change to the FAT32EBD directory by typing the following:

	CD\TOOLS\MTSUTIL\FAT32EBD    [press Enter key]

3. Run FAT32EBD.EXE and follow its prompts to create a FAT32 EBD. Run
   the utility by typing:

	FAT32EBD.EXE    [press Enter key]

4. Write-protect the diskette when it is finished creating the EBD to
   ensure a virus cannot write to the disk. 

5. Restart the computer with the FAT32 EBD.


=====================
CREATING FAT32 DRIVES
=====================

In Windows 98, if you run the FDISK tool on a system with a drive
over 512 MB in size, you will be asked whether or not to enable large
disk support. If you answer Yes, any partition you create that is
larger than 512 MB is marked as a FAT32 partition.

   NOTE: The Drive Converter (FAT32) can be run if Windows 98 is
         installed. See online help for additional information.


============
KNOWN ISSUES
============

If you experience difficulty running FAT32EBD.EXE, please refer to
the following list of known issues for the tool.

-------------------------------
Invalid files copied to the EBD
-------------------------------

If the files on the FAT32 EBD are 0 (zero) bytes in size, it may be
the result of the TMP environment variable being set to the floppy
drive, or insufficient conventional memory.

TMP environment variable set to floppy drive
--------------------------------------------

Booting with a floppy disk may set the TMP environment variable to the
floppy drive. FAT32EBD.EXE requires the TMP environment variable be
set to a hard disk. If TMP is set to the floppy drive, FAT32EBD.EXE
may create a boot disk with zero byte files. 

Determine the current status of the TMP by typing:

	SET	[press Enter key]

Set the TMP environment variable to the hard drive by typing:

	SET TMP=C:\	[press Enter key]

Insufficient conventional memory
--------------------------------

FAT32EBD.EXE relies on the Windows 98 EXTRACT.EXE utility. EXTRACT
requires approximately 520K of free conventional memory. Loading
real-mode CD-ROM drivers and DriveSpace/DoubleSpace compression
drivers can reduce the amount of conventional memory. To workaround
this, modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load devices
high.

   ---- Example CONFIG.SYS ----

   Device=C:\windows\himem.sys
   Device=C:\windows\Emm386.exe noems
   Dos=high,umb
   Devicehigh=C:\CDROM\oakcdrom.sys /d:mscd001
   Devicehigh=C:\Windows\drvspace.sys /move

   ---- Example AUTOEXEC.BAT ----

   LH C:\CDROM\mscdex.exe /d:mscd001

----------------------------
Bad or corrupted Floppy Disk
----------------------------

If FAT32EBD.EXE generates a "Write fault" or "Can not write to Disk
in Drive A:\" error, you may be using a damaged floppy disk. 

-----------------------------------
Slow performance creating Boot Disk
-----------------------------------

FAT32EBD.EXE extracts files for the FAT32 EBD from the Windows 98 CD.
EXTRACT.EXE may run slowly outside of Windows. To improve the
performance of FAT32EBD.EXE outside of Windows, load SMARTDRV.EXE. 

   NOTE: The Windows 98 SMARTDRV.EXE may be loaded from the
         \TOOLS\OLDMSDOS folder on the Windows 98 CD.

-----------------------
Windows 98 Startup Disk
-----------------------

The FAT32 EBD does not include all of the troubleshooting tools
available on the Windows 98 Startup Disk. Microsoft recommends
creating a Windows 98 Startup Disk during Windows 98
setup, or from the Startup disk tab in the Control Panel's Add/Remove
Programs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A computer virus is an executable file designed to replicate itself
and avoid detection. A virus may try to avoid detection by disguising
itself as a legitimate program. Viruses are often rewritten and
adjusted so that they will not be detected. Anti-virus programs must
be updated continuously to look for new and modified viruses.

When a computer boots (or starts), it looks to the boot sector of the
hard disk before loading the operating system or any other startup
files. A boot sector virus is designed to replace the information in
the hard disk's boot sectors with its own code. When a computer is
infected with a boot sector virus, the virus' code is read into
memory before anything else. Once in memory, it can replicate itself
onto any other disks that are used in the infected computer.

--------------------
Description of FAT32
--------------------

Windows 98 provides an updated version of the File Allocation Table
file system, called FAT32. This updated file system allows for a
default cluster size as small as 4K, as well as support for EIDE
hard disk sizes in excess of 2 GB.

 - A FAT32 volume cannot be compressed using Microsoft DriveSpace or 
   DriveSpace 3.

 - FAT32 volumes cannot be accessed if the computer is started using
   another operating system. 

 - MS-DOS, Windows NT 3.x and 4.x, Windows 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x, and 
   Windows 95 (950) may not recognize a FAT32 volume.

   NOTE: Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (1111) supports FAT32.

FAT32 provides the following enhancements over previous
implementations of the FAT file system:

 - Supports drives up to 2 terabytes in size.

 - FAT32 uses smaller clusters (that is, 4K clusters for drives up to
   8 GB in size), resulting in 10 to 15 percent more efficient use of
   disk space relative to large FAT16 drives.

 - FAT32 has the ability to relocate the root directory and use the
   backup copy of the FAT instead of the default copy. In addition,
   the boot record on FAT32 drives has been expanded to include a
   backup of critical data structures. This means that FAT32 drives
   are less susceptible to a single point of failure than existing
   FAT16 volumes.

 - The root directory on a FAT32 drive is now an ordinary cluster
   chain, so it can be located anywhere on the drive. For this reason,
   the previous limitations on the number of root directory entries
   no longer exist.
