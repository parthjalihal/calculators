INTRODUCTION
============

PMTShoot is a tool to assist you in identifying the
application or device driver that prevents your computer
from entering its standby (or suspended) state.

PMTShoot monitors your computer system as it suspends,
emphasizing those applications and drivers that can prevent
your computer from suspending.

As your system suspends and then resumes, you will see text
displayed by PMTShoot.  This text is grouped according to
the phases that comprise the suspend process. In many
cases, you will find this grouping useful in diagnosing
the cause of the suspend failure.


============
INSTALLATION
============

Follow these instructions to install PMTShoot on your computer.

1. Run PMTShoot.exe

   There are two ways to run PMTShoot:
     A. From the Run dialog box:
        1.  Insert the Windows 98 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive
	2.  Click on Start, Run...
        3.  Type D:\TOOLS\MSTUTIL\PMTSHOOT\PMTSHOOT.EXE (assuming 
	    D: is your CD-ROM drive)
	4.  Click OK

     B. From Windows Explorer:
        1.  Navagate to the D:\TOOLS\MSTUTIL\PMTSHOOT directory
        2.  Double-click on PMTShoot.exe

2.  Click Yes when setup asks if you would like
    to continue.

3.  Click OK when setup notifies you that a reboot
    is necessary.

4.  Click OK when setup asks you to restart your computer.

5.  At this point, your computer will restart.


=====
USAGE
=====

Once installed, PMTShoot will run automatically when Windows
starts.  Once PMTShoot is running, you can suspend your
computer as you normally would.  As it suspends, PMTShoot
displays all the activity on your computer.

Once your computer has finished its suspend/resume process,
note the text displayed by PMTShoot.  You may need to
scroll up/down to see all of the text.  If you do not see
a vertical scroll bar, resize the window slightly.  This
will create a vertical scroll bar.

Take note of the information displayed in red.  This is what
PMTShoot considers to be most relevant to the suspend failure.
Often, PMTShoot will display, in red, the name of the device
and driver that caused the suspend to fail.  With this
information, you can make the necessary adjustments to
resolve the problem.
