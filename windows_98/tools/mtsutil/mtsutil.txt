When you start Windows 98 you may not receive a Windows or Network
logon dialog box.  You may also receive one of the following error
messages:

 - No network provider accepted the given network path.

 - The operation being requested was not performed because the
   user has not logged on to the network. The specified service
   does not exist.

In addition, the Change Passwords tab may be missing from the
Passwords Properties dialog box.

This behavior can occur if the AutoLogon entry appears in the
following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\Real Mode Net 

      AutoLogon=<x>

   where <x> is a number.

DEFRAG.INF - DEFRAGMENT ALL DRIVES ON SUBSEQUENT WINDOWS STARTUP
================================================================

The Disk Defragmenter for Windows 98 (DEFRAG.EXE) may start and
not complete its task. If repeated attempts to defragment the drive
are unsuccessful, it may be because an application is writing to the 
disk. The Disk Defragementer cannot share access
to a drive with other tasks. 

An application loading automatically at startup may interfere
with DEFRAG. Run DEFRAG before applications load at startup by adding
a value for DEFRAG.EXE /ALL to the RunServicesOnce key in the
registry.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To add a value for DEFRAG.EXE /ALL to the RunServicesOnce key:

IPAC_OFF.INF - DISABLE TCP/IP IP AUTOCONFIGURATION
==================================================

The Windows 98 TCP/IP stack supports a new mechanism for automatic
address assignment of IP addresses for simple LAN-based network
configurations. IP Autoconfiguration Addressing is an extension of
dynamic IP address assignment for LAN adapters. It enables
configuration of IP addresses without using static IP address
assignment or installing a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DHCP) server. 

If a network LAN adapter is configured for TCP/IP, and if "Obtain
an IP address automatically" is selected on the IP Address tab in
the TCP/IP Properties dialog box, Windows 98 TCP/IP attempts to find
and use a DHCP service on the attached network to obtain a
dynamically assigned IP address. If it does not find a DHCP service,
Windows 98 uses IP Autoconfiguration Addressing by assigning the
adapter an Class B IP address out of the network number 169.254.x.x
IP address space. In this way, two PCs can be plugged into a LAN hub
and can start without any IP address configuration, and can use
TCP/IP networking for internetworking. Each computer that uses IP
Autoconfiguration Addressing gets an IP address and tests to
determine that the IP address is unique and not already in use on the
LAN.

IP Autoconfiguration Addressing is enabled by default. IP
Autoconfiguration Addressing can be controlled by setting the value
of IPAutoconfigurationEnabled (type DWORD) in the registry key
 
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System
	   \CurrentControlSet
	      \Services
	         \VXD
	            \DHCP
	               
If the value of IPAutoconfigurationEnabled is nonzero or if the
registry key is absent, IP Autoconfiguration Addressing is enabled.
An IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value of 0 disables the IP
Autoconfiguration Addressing feature. 

If Windows 98 initially does not detect a DHCP service and configures
an IP Autoconfiguration IP address, and then it subsequently
discovers a DHCP service on the network, Windows 98 uses the DHCP
service and switches from 169.254.x.x addressing to IP addresses
assigned by a DHCP server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To set the registry value for IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value to 0:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Select IPAC_OFF.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the 
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click IPAC_OFF.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to modify the IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value.


================================================
IPAC_ON.INF - ENABLE TCP/IP IP AUTOCONFIGURATION
================================================

Refer to the previous section for information concerning
IP Autoconfiguration.

IP Autoconfiguration Addressing is enabled if the value of
IPAutoconfigurationEnabled is nonzero or if the registry key
is absent.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To set the registry value for IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value to 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Select IPAC_ON.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the 
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click IPAC_ON.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to modify the IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value.

MAPC_OFF.INF - DISABLE MAPPING OF CACHED PAGES
==============================================

Windows 98 supports the mapping of cached pages to increase the
amount of memory available to running applications. The Windows 98
memory manager architecture divides memory into 2 parts:

 - Protected-mode disk cache (VCACHE)

 - Memory allocated to run programs and hold data (VMM) 

Reading from memory is much faster than reading from the hard disk.
VCACHE improves performance by reducing the number of times the hard
disk is accessed.  A process in memory will demand a particular
section of code; if that section of code is in VCACHE, it can be
accessed and used much more quickly than if that section of code
needs to be read from a file on disk. For example, if you were to
launch an application, close it, and then shortly thereafter launch
it a second time, the application's launch time would now be
noticeably reduced. This is a result of copying much of the
application from VCACHE instead of the hard disk.

Memory allocated to the disk cache is not available to executing
processes. Reducing the amount of memory available to running
applications negatively impacts performance by increasing the amount
of data swapped from memory to the hard disk. Once again, reading
from memory is much faster than reading from the swap file on the
hard disk. 

In Windows 95, there are two instances of some code in physical
memory; one instance stored in the disk cache to reduce the time
required to load the application should it be invoked again, and
another instance in VMM for the running application. Eliminating the
instance of the data in the cache would increase the amount of memory
available to VMM, but would negatively impact application reload
times.

Windows 98 supports the mapping of cached pages to increase the
amount of memory available to running applications. Memory mapped
I/O from the cache eliminates needless duplication of data while
the application is running. Application code is loaded into VCACHE,
and then executes out of the cache rather than having to be copied
to another part of memory before it executes. When the application is
closed, the memory manager labels the space that application was
using as not currently being used to maintain the benefits of
caching--if the application is not restarted, that space is given to
other tasks. If the application is restarted, the application still
exists in the cache, maintaining improved application reload times.

Windows 98 maps cached pages by default. This performance enhancement
can be disable by creating a MapCache entry in the registry key
 
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System
	   \CurrentControlSet
	      \Services
	         \VXD
	            \VMM
	               
If the MapCache entry does not exist, Windows 98 will map cached
pages. Creating the MapCache entry will disable the mapping of
cached pages.  

------------------------------------------
To create the registry entry for MapCache:
------------------------------------------

1. Select MAPC_OFF.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the 
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click MAPC_OFF.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to create the entry for MapCache.


============================================
MAPC_ON.INF - ENABLE MAPPING OF CACHED PAGES
============================================

Refer to the previous section for information concerning the mapping
of cached pages.

Windows 98 will map cached pages if the entry for MapCache is
absent.
 
------------------------------------------
To remove the registry entry for MapCache:
------------------------------------------

1. Select MAPC_ON.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click MAPC_ON.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to remove the entry for MapCache.


============================================================
NNT.INF - REMOVE THE NAMENUMERICTALE VALUE FROM THE REGISTRY
============================================================

If you add the "NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry (as
documented on page 688 of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit)
and then run Windows 98 Setup, Microsoft Plus! 98 Setup, or the
Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel, programs in the Program
Files folder may no longer work correctly.

When you add the "NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry,
Windows 98 Setup, Microsoft Plus! Setup, or the Add/Remove Programs
tool may change the short name for the Program Files folder. For
example, if you run the Add/Remove Programs tool after you add the
"NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry, the short name for the
Program Files folder may be changed from Progra~1 to Programf.

If the short name for the Program Files folder is different from
the name that the program you are trying to run expects, the program
may not be able to locate the folders and files it needs.

Various tools and components installed in the Program Files folder
may use short file names internally or during installation. If the
short name for the Program Files folder is different from the short
name expected by a tool or component, the problems described in this
article may occur. This problem can affect any program installed
in the Program Files folder.

The "NameNumericTail=0" value is not supported in Windows 98.
Although this registry value works as expected, it can cause 
problems for Windows 98 components.

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Delete the value "NameNumericTail=0" from the following registry
   key:

      Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

2. Using Windows Explorer or My Computer, rename the Program Files
   folder to Programs.fld.

3. Rename the Programs.fld folder to Program Files.

   Note: renaming the folder forces a new short name for the folder
         to be generated.

------------------------------------------------------
To remove the NameNumericTail value from the registry:
------------------------------------------------------

1. Select NNT.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the 
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click NNT.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to remove the NameNumericTail value.


=========================================
NOIDE.INF - REMOVE THE NOIDE REGISTRY KEY
=========================================

If your computer contains a PCI-IDE hard disk controller that
employs serialization between the two IDE channels, you may
experience the following problems:

 - 32-bit file system access and 32-bit virtual memory are
   not available.

 - Device Manager displays an exclamation point in a yellow
   circle for the primary and secondary IDE channels.

Removing and reinstalling the hard disk controller does not
resolve the problem.

This can occur if the protected-mode driver for the hard disk 
controller was not properly initialized when you started
Windows 98 previously. When this occurs, a NOIDE entry is placed
in the  registry, preventing Windows 98 from making future attempts
to initialize the protected-mode driver.

This problem can occur with an IDE controller that requires
serialization between the primary and secondary IDE channels. 
The protected-mode drivers for these IDE controllers can fail to
be initialized if one of the following situations occurs:

 - One IDE channel has a supported hard disk, and the second channel
   has a CD-ROM or other type of drive that requires real-mode
   drivers to be loaded. Because of the serialization between the two
   IDE channels, it is impossible to access the hard disk in
   protected mode and use the other device in real mode. This causes
   the protected-mode driver to fail initialization, and the NOIDE
   switch is placed in the registry to prevent future errors. Both
   disk devices then operate in real-mode.

 - The driver for the IDE controller is manually removed from
   Device Manager and then reinstalled, or the protected-mode driver
   is disabled and then re-enabled. Some PCI controller drivers are
   not designed for dynamic enabling and disabling, and can cause the
   protected-mode driver to fail initialization.

To cause Windows 98 to attempt to reinitialize the protected-mode IDE
driver, remove the NOIDE entry from the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\VXD\IOS

--------------------------------------------
To remove the NOIDE entry from the registry:
--------------------------------------------

1. Select NOIDE.INF found in the \Tools\MTSutil folder on the 
   Windows 98 CD.

2. Right-Click NOIDE.INF.
	-or-
   Hold down the SHIFT key and press the function key, F10.

3. Choose INSTALL to remove the NOIDE entry.

After you update the registry, restart Windows 98. Windows 98 will
then attempt to initialize the protected-mode driver for the
controller. If no problems are encountered, the file system and 
virtual memory will operate in 32-bit mode, and Device Manager will
not display an exclamation point in a yellow circle for the
IDE channels.

If the protected-mode driver is not initialized properly, an error
message will be displayed and the NOIDE registry entry will be
re-created. Windows 98 will use the MS-DOS compatibility mode file
system the next time you start the computer.

PTXT_ON.INF - SENDS PLAIN-TEXT PASSWORDS TO YOUR NETWORK SERVER
===============================================================

For security reasons, Windows 98 will not allow you to send plain-
text passwords. The password is encrypted by default. However,
Samba servers require plain-text passwords, so you will not be able
to connect to Samba servers unless you change a Registry entry to
enable plain-text passwords.

   Caution: Enabling plain-text passwords could compromise security.

To enable plain-text passwords, add the Registry entry for
EnablePlainTextPassword (as a Dword) and set the value to 1 in the
following Registry location:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System
	   \CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Vnetsup

--------------------------------------------------
To set the value for EnablePlainTextPassword to 1:
--------------------------------------------------

REMFDMA.INF - DISABLES FDMA ON PCI-ISA BRIDGE DEVICES
=====================================================

Having FDMA capability enabled on some PCI-ISA bridge devices can
result in loss of audio when recording using an Aztech 2320 based
audio device and the Aztech 2320 WDM audio driver.  REMFDMA.INF will
disable FDMA capability on the PCI-ISA bridge, allowing audio
recording to function properly.  However, with FDMA disabled, digital
joysticks may not operate properly.

result in the degradation, or loss, of digital joysticks' operability
when audio is playing. ADDFDMA.INF restores FDMA capabilities that
were disabled with REMFDMA.INF. 

   Note: Not all PCI-ISA bridge devices are able to take advantage of
         FDMA, regardless of whether or not ADDFDMA.INF or
         REMFDMA.INF are used.  Also, enabling FDMA on some PCI-ISA
         bridge devices may result in loss of audio during record
         operations when using an Aztech 2320 based audio device and
         its WDM audio driver.
