RESTORING YOUR SYSTEM BY USING SYSTEM RECOVERY
==============================================

The System Recovery program restores your Windows 98 
system by using the full backup that you created with 
Microsoft Backup. To use System Recovery to restore 
your system, you must have:

- Your Windows 98 CD-ROM

- A backup device connected to your computer

- A full system backup created with Microsoft Backup


>>>To restore Windows 98 on your computer:

1. Insert your Windows Startup Disk into your floppy disk drive, 
   and then start your computer.

2. On the Boot menu, choose Start your computer with 
   CD-ROM support.

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type
       
	n:
	(where N is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive)

   and then press ENTER.
	
4. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type   

	CD tools\sysrec

   and then press ENTER.

5. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type   
 
	pcrestor

   and then press ENTER.

6. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

   This reinstalls Windows 98 on your computer. When Setup is
   complete, the System Recovery wizard starts.

>>>To use the System Recovery wizard to restore your files:

1. In the System Recovery wizard, click Next.

2. Type your name and company, and then click Next.

3. Click Details.

4. In the Help window, read the entire Backup Help topic.
   This explains the entire recovery process.

5. When you have finished reading the Help topic, click the
   Close button.

6. In the System Recovery wizard, click Finish. 
   The Microsoft Backup Welcome screen appears.

IMPORTANT: If you click Cancel, click Yes, and then restart 
your system. The System Recovery wizard automatically starts.


7. In the Microsoft Backup dialog box, click Restore backed 
   up files. 

8. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

   IMPORTANT: You should restore hardware settings ONLY 
   if your hardware is the same as when you made the backup.

   The entire backup of the registry is restored, as are 
   all selected local drives.


   -OR-


   If you do not click Restore hardware and system settings 
   to the registry but continue with the operation, your 
   software settings and configuration will be restored along 
   with all selected local drives. 

   Restore all your new and changed files (incremental) 
   backups. Begin with the oldest and progress to the most 
   recent incremental backup. 


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

No Access to Backup Device
--------------------------

If you cannot gain access to your backup device while 
running the System Recovery wizard, it is most 
likely because the driver for the backup device 
is not installed. 

>>>To install the driver for your backup device:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, 
   and then double-click System.

2. Click Device Manager, double-click your backup 
   device, and then click Driver.

3. Click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions 
   on your screen. When you are prompted for a disk, 
   insert the disk that came with your backup device.
