Microsoft Remote Registry service (REGSERV.EXE and related files)

Install this software on Windows 95 or Windows 98 computers to 
allow administrators to change Registry entries on other computers 
over the network.

The local and remote computers must each be running the Remote 
Registry service, and user-level security must be enabled on 
the computer you are administering. To change the Registry, 
you can use Registry Editor or System Policy Editor.

To install this service, use the Network option in Control Panel, click
the Add button, select Service as the type of network component to
install, click the Add button, click the Have Disk button, and install
from the TOOLS\RESKIT\NETADMIN\REMOTREG directory.

For more information about the Remote Registry Service, see that topic 
in the Windows 98 Resource Kit or in the Windows 98 Resource Kit tools online help
(WIN98RK.HLP). You can access this help by installing the Windows 98 Resource Kit tools sampler from the TOOLS\RESKIT directory of the Windows 98 compact disc.
