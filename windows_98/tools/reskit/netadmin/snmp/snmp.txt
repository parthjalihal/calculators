SNMP Agent (SNMP.EXE and related files)

Use this software to monitor remote connections to computers running 
Windows 95 or Windows 98 if your network uses Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
system management products for system management. 

The Windows 95 SNMP agent conforms to the SNMP version 1 specification.
This agent allows you to monitor, from an SNMP console, remote connections 
to computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98. After this agent is installed, 
you do not need to make any other modifications to client computers 
to use SNMP. The SNMP agent is implemented as a Win32-based service 
and works using Windows Sockets over both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX. 
The extension agents are implemented as Win32 DLLs.

To install SNMP Agent on a computer already running Windows 98, 
use the Network icon in Control Panel, click the Add button,
select Service as the type of network component to install, click
the Add button, click the Have Disk button, and install from the
TOOLS\RESKIT\NETADMIN\SNMP directory. 

For more information, see that topic in the Windows 98 Resource Kit 
or in the Windows 98 Resource Kit tools online help (WIN98RK.HLP). You can 
access this help by installing the Windows 98 Resource Kit tools sampler 
from the TOOLS\RESKIT directory of the Windows 98 compact disc.
