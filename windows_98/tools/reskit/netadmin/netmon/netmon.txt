Network Monitor Agent (NMAGENT.* and related files)

The NETMON folder includes the software for a protocol driver and 
agent for Microsoft Network Monitor. The protocol driver provides 
performance counters that can be viewed by using System Monitor 
if you want to assess certain network traffic statistics for 
NDIS 3.1 protected-mode network adapters. 

The Network Monitor agent, which can run either as a Windows 95 or 
Windows 98 service, works with the protocol driver for use with the 
Microsoft Network Monitor application. You can use this application 
to detect and troubleshoot problems on LANs, WANs, and Microsoft Remote
Access Service (RAS) connections.

NOTE: The Network Monitor application is provided with Microsoft 
Systems Management Server, which is a client-server system that 
allows administrators to perform key management functions for 
distributed computers from a central location. 

To use Network Monitor Agent to troubleshoot problems on the network, 
you must install it (NMAGENT.EXE) on each computer you want 
to monitor on the network. 

To install Network Monitor Agent on a computer already running 
Windows 95 or Windows 98, use the Network icon in Control Panel, 
click the Add button, select Service as the type of network component
to install, click the Add button, click the Have Disk button, and 
install from the TOOLS\RESKIT\NETADMIN\NETMON directory.
 
You can also install Network Monitor Agent using statements in 
setup scripts. For more information about Network Monitor Agent, 
see that topic in the Windows 98 Resource Kit or in the 
Windows 98 Resource Kit tools online help (WIN98RK.HLP). You can 
access this help by installing the Windows 98 Resource Kit tools 
sampler from the TOOLS\RESKIT directory of the Windows 98 compact disc.
