2. TweakUI Target Audience
------------------------------------------------


TweakUI is intended for the advanced user.  

Changes made in TweakUI change settings in the registry and can affect the
behavior and appearance of Windows.  While this provides a greater level of
customization, it also presents a greater risk of making changes that will
leave Windows in an unusable state.

It is recommended that you backup you registry before making any changes in
TweakUI.  To backup your registry, you can click on Start/Run and type in
"Scanregw" (without the quotes).

please keep in mind, this tool is not a part of Windows and is not supported 
by Microsoft. For this reason, Microsoft Technical Support is unable to 
answer questions about TweakUI.

6. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------


Q.  On some tabs there's a Restore Factory Settings button and on other tabs
    there's not. Why?

A.  On the tabs that offer the Restore Factory Settings button, the default
    Windows value for that option is clearly understood.  On tabs that do 
    not offer the button, the values could be different depending on how 
    Windows was installed.

Q.  On the General Tab is a list of Special Folders with an option to change
    locations.  What are all of these and what impact is there on changing
    them?

A.  These are system folders that are defined by Windows during install.  
    Some users may want to change the locations of these folders for a 
    variety of reasons.  A few cautionary notes about changing Special 
    Folder locations:

	1) Changing the Special Folder locations will not copy over the
	   information from the old location to the new.

	2) Do not point 2 or more Special Folders to the same location.

	3) Do not point a Special Folder to a system folder like the Fonts 
           folder.

Q.  The My Computer tab allows me to hide drives on my system.  What impact 
    will this have?

A.  Hiding drives will affect other functionality.  For instance, if you 
    hide drives, the Explore and Open options on a right click on the Start 
    Menu will be grayed out.

Q.  The Repair Tab offers a Repair System Files option.  How does this 
    relate to System File Checker?

A.  System File Checker is a new support utility for Windows 98.  System 
    File Checker provides a broader scope of checking system files and 
    correcting any problems.

Q.  Where can I find the latest information on TweakUI?

A.  The latest information on TweakUI can be found on the Windows 98 
    website: http://www.microsoft.com/windows98.  You can also find current
    information about TweakUI in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.  Just go to:
