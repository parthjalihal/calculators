IBM THINKPAD 770 ULTRA BAY HOT SWAP 
  DRIVER FOR WINDOWS 98

-------------------------------------


IBM THINKPAD 770 ULTRA BAY HOT SWAP DRIVER 
FOR WINDOWS 98
==========================================

The IBM ThinkPad 770 Ultra Bay hot swap virtual 
device driver under Windows 95 provides the user 
the ability to hot swap disk drives, CD-ROM and 
DVD-ROM drives, or a secondary battery.

When you upgrade to Windows 98, your original 
Ultra Bay hot swap driver does not allow you to 
use the suspend/resume power management feature. 
After you install Windows 98, replace the existing 
file (IBMBAY.VxD) with the one included in this 
directory.

>>>To replace the original file

1. Make a backup of the IBMBAY.VxD file located in 
   the System subfolder of your Windows folder. 

2. Copy the IBMBAY.VxD in this folder to the 
   System subfolder of your Windows folder.

3. Restart your computer.

The suspend/resume feature will work after you 
restart your computer.

This file replacement is only required for 
ThinkPad 770 systems with Windows 95 preloaded.
