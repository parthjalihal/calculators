      After you have installed your storage device, turn your system back on.
      Once Windows detects your newly added storage device, the "Add New Hardware
      Wizard" will appear.

      Please note:  Choosing cancel at any point during this installation
      could result in an inability to change the storage device driver.
      If this happens, reboot the system and go to safe mode.  Follow the
      instructions in the Troubleshooter to reinstall you device driver.

      Read Message and then click the "Next" button.

      Under "What do you want Windows to do?" choose the option that says
      "Search for the best driver for your device." (will be the option 
      selected by default).
      Then click the "Next" button.

      Place a check in the Check-box beside "Specify a location:" and remove
      check-marks from all other check-boxes.
     
      Specify the path to the new driver and then click the "Next" button.
      
          Example 1: Insert the drivers disk in the A: floppy drive,
                     and enter A:\.

          Example 2: Type in the name of the directory where you copied
                     the drivers, either on your local hard drive or
                     on a storage share.

          Example 3: If you're not sure exactly where the drivers are,
                     choose the "Browse..." button are find them.

      The "Add New Hardware Wizard" will reappear with the name of the storage
      device that you have installed in your machine. 
      Read message and then click the "Next" button.

      Windows 98 will copy the storage drivers to the proper directories
      on your system.

      When Windows 98 has finished copying the drivers, click the "Finish"
      button.
      
      Windows98 will prompt you to now restart your system to make the new drivers
      active.
