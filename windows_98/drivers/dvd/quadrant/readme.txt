Important Installation Information
========= ============ ===========

Windows98 comes with a version of these drivers (cinemst2.sys and vdmindvd.sys) and will use the files from the installation media first if they are available.  Therefore you may have to manually copy the two .sys files from this directory into system32\drivers to make sure your system has the latest version.
