This file describes the normal audio driver installation procedures for
Windows 98. The first two procedures are used when installing drivers
for an audio device not previously installed in the system.

The first of these procedures is for Plug and Play (PnP) devices. These
devices will be detected by the system and require minimal user input. The
system will know which device is installed in the system and which drivers
are valid for it. (all of the drivers included in this directory are for
PnP devices)

The second procedure is for legacy audio devices. The user will need to know
which audio device is installed, both by manufacturer and model. Take a look
at any documentation you may have or look in the Device Manager under the
driver's properties page. Explicit instructions are listed below.

The last procedure is for upgrading or replacing the audio drivers currently
in use.  We recommend that you use these procedures when installing the audio 
drivers provided in this directory.

DRIVER INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.  

Use this procedure for installing your device drivers on an audio device not 
previously installed on your system:

      After you have installed your Audio Adapter, turn your system back on.
      Once Windows detects your newly added audio adapter, the "Add New Hardware
      Wizard" will appear. If it does not detect your device, it is most
      likely not Plug and Play compatible. Use the procedure below entitled
      "LEGACY AUDIO DEVICES".

      Please note:  Choosing cancel at any point during this installation
      could result in an inability to change the audio adapter driver.
      If this happens, reboot the system and go to safe mode.  Follow the
      instructions in the Troubleshooter to reinstall you device driver.
