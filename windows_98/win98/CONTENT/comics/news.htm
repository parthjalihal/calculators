A stop at the Garfield Web site (www.garfield.com) provides visitors with the kind of entertainment you'd expect from the world's most famous fat, lazy cat. You'll find games (watch out for falling dinners in the Lasagna from Heaven game), postcards, merchandise, lasagna recipes and (of course) loads of comic strips.
     <P>
     More surprising is the Web site's peek behind the scenes at Paws Inc., the creative studio founded by Garfield creator Jim Davis in 1981 to handle the writing, drawing and designing of such Garfield products as T-shirts, books, figurines, posters, stuffed toys and calendars.

     For a tour, go to www.garfield.com/paws and check out the art department, Jim's office and Paws' own solar aquatic system water treatment plant. The S.A.S. plant treats Paws' waste water in a chemical-free manner, using natural purifiers such as algae, snails, bulrushes and minnows.
     <P>  
     If you have the QuickTimeVR plug-in for your browser, you can get a 360 degree tour of Paws (including the water treatment plant). But there's plenty to see -- and do -- even without the fancy stuff. Don't miss the list of the top ten strips Jim tried before Garfield (www.garfield.com/paws/jimdavis/topten/).
