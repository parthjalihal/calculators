<H3>A Solution: Accept It . . . </h3>



<font size=3><b>Y</b></font>our mother has every legal and

                      logical right to do exactly as she

                      pleases with her money. Don't make

                      this issue into one of sibling rivalry

                      or to evaluate how much your mother

                      loves you. Simply accept that this is

                      her money and, as an adult, she can

                      do as she pleases with it. How would

                      you feel if she were trying to tell you

                      and your husband what to do with

                      your money?  </div>

<H3>A Solution: So Be It. . . </h3>



<font size=3><b>P</b></font>lease do not take this wrong, but It

                      ticks me off when I hear this. You

                      love you parent right? You should let

                      them do what they want with their

                      and I emphasize their belongings.

                      They earned it and have the right to

                      make decisions about them. YOu

                      should be content to know that your

                      parents loved you. The rest is

                      meaningless. memories should satisfy

                      all. If one gets more than the other

                      because the parent felt this would

                      help best that way. so be it.  </div>

<H3>A Solution: Count Your Blessings. . . </h3>

<font size=3><b>T</b></font>he things in life that are of value

                      cannot be bought with money.

                      Obviously, your mother's heart is at

                      peace knowing you are well taken

                      care of and do not need her as much

                      as your sister does. She was able to

                      share her decision with you because

                      she felt you would understand and

                      have the same compassion for your

                      sister as she does. You have an

                      "equal", "friend" relationship with

                      your mother that your sister does

                      not. My mother has no money to

                      leave me but she has given me

                      everything--her love, friendship and

                      herself. Count your blessings and not

                      the bucks!  </div>
