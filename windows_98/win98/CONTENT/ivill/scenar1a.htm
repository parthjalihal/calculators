<H3>The Dilemma: Problem Child!</h3><no br>

	<font size=3><b>M</b></font>y son, who is now 4, is a difficult child. He's hot-tempered,

                              won't pay attention and won't do what he is told. He had a rotten

                                year in nursery school and his teacher and his pediatrician both

                          say that they think he has ADD. I don't want my kid labelled and I

                                 don't want him to take medication. I think we can deal with his

                            behavior with patience and hard work. My husband is siding with

                              the pediatrician and we are arguing about this. Should I go along

                                                           with everyone else or should I trust my instincts?</DIV>

<H3>A Solution: See a Doctor. . .</h3>



<font size=3><b>I</b></font>











                       highly recommend you have your child

                      seen by a child psychologist who may spend

                      more time with your son than his

                      pediatrician did. My step-son spent an hour

                      a week with a psych. for 6 mos before he

                      recommended medication. Only after much

                      evaluation and some fun, and relatively easy

                      "tests" did we agree and understand our son

                      would benefit from meds. Your son is young

                      still and you may want to wait and see how

                      his Kindergarten teacher view his "behavior".

                      You are right that children like this need

                      patience, but when in situations where other

                      children begin to shun a child, or a child

                      KNOWS he is "different" due to ADD,

                      medication can be very helpful. We have

                      seen some improvement in our child's

                      self-esteem in school, and socially since last

                      year. Medication should never be the ONLY

                      treatment for these kids. They need to work

                      on using their "brakes", as my son's Dr.

                      would put it. With encouragement and love

                      from their parents, children with ADD/ADHD

                      can thrive and feel good about themselves.

                      Good luck.</div>

<H3>A Solution: You Are Lucky. . . </h3>



<font size=3><b>Y</b></font>ou dont know how lucky you all are over in

                      the USA at least it is recognised and treated.

                      We in England have to fight tooth and nail to

                      get help. The Schools dont beleive in it, they

                      would rather exclude children that help

                      them. The GPs dont like giving medication

                      once diagnosed some GPs wont admit there

                      is a problem. the Psychiatry/Pschology

                      Deptparments are very few and far between

                      over here who beleive in this disorder. I

                      would accept any help. My Son was

                      diagnosed with ADHD last year aged 12yrs

                      he has lost out on 7yrs of schooling because

                      he was not given the correct management he

                      was thrown out of schools for what . Just

                      because he hummed and walk around and

                      could concentrate. you would have thought

                      the signs were there they would have done

                      something to help. He is 13 now and is still

                      struggling even now he is diagnosed the

                      school is still not living up to there part and

                      I am afraid my son will be another statisic at

                      aged 16 I dont want that and as a mum you

                      wont want that for your child also.

<H3>A Solution: Read This Book. . . </h3>

<font size=3><b>T</b></font>here's an excellent book out there called

                      "Raising your spirited child" It's been a real

                      life saver for me. My older son is four and

                      sounds quite similar to yours. That book has

                      helped my husband and I realize how our

                      personalities conflict with our son's. We have

                      been pouring tremendous effort into him. I

                      don't like the idea of drugging someone in

                      order to get them to behave a certain way.

                      We have recently sought a counselor who

                      believes that ADD is over diagnosed. He

                      believes that 15% of the kids could be called

                      "difficult" and one of ours falls into that

                      category. We're learning new ways to deal

                      with him and feel that we're making some

                      good progress. Our society is too busy

                      looking for a quick fix to everything.

                      Marriages take a lot of work on both sides;

                      healthy meals take planning and a little

                      extra work; and I believe most behavorial

                      problems can be worked out as well. </div>
