INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
PAN-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
=============================

Windows 98 includes all the support provided in 
the Pan-European Edition of Windows 95.  
It provides both program support and document 
support for:

- Existing localized Greek, Russian, Polish, 
  Hungarian, Czech, Turkish, and Slovenian 
  Windows 3.x, and Windows 95 programs. 
- Markets that did not have a localized version 
  of Windows 3.x but were supported by the 
  Windows 3.x version for Central and Eastern 
  Europe. This includes the Albanian, Croatian, 
  Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, and Slovenian markets.
- Markets that did not have a localized version 
  of Windows 95 but were supported by the 
  Pan-European Edition of Windows 95. This 
  includes the Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, 
  Croatian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, 
  Serbian, Slovak, and Ukrainian markets.


PROGRAM SUPPORT
===============

Windows 98 provides support for localized programs. 
For example, you can run Russian Microsoft Excel 97 
on Microsoft Windows 98.


DOCUMENT SUPPORT
================

Using Windows 98, you can create a multilingual 
document with TrueType fonts in all programs 
that support TrueType fonts. For example, you 
can now create a document in Microsoft Word 97 
for Windows that includes Czech, Russian, Greek, 
and French text.


INSTALLING SUPPORT FOR YOUR COUNTRY
===================================

You can install this version of Windows 98 
by upgrading from an existing installation 
of Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, 
Windows 95, or on a computer that is currently 
running MS-DOS only. By default, your existing 
settings are detected and maintained. For 
example, when you upgrade from Polish Microsoft 
Windows 95, your default regional settings are 
still in Polish, your default keyboard still 
generates Polish characters, and you run your 
MS-DOS-based and Windows-based programs as you 
did before.

If you install Windows 98 on a computer that is 
currently running MS-DOS only, you should specify 
the Regional Settings you want during Setup. The 
default is English (United States). 

>>> To change your regional settings:

1. During Setup, select the Custom option 
   in the Windows 98 Setup Wizard.
 
2. In the Computer Settings dialog box, click 
   Regional Settings, click Change, and then 
   click the country you want.

3. To ensure that you have the correct support 
   for your language, choose the appropriate 
   keyboard layout in the Computer Settings 
   dialog box.
 
   This installs a keyboard layout for Windows-based 
   and MS-DOS-based programs. 

   NOTE: Some languages default to the U.S. 
   keyboard that is defined for MS-DOS windows 
   and MS-DOS based programs.


REGIONAL SETTINGS
=================

Windows 98 defines which Windows and MS-DOS code 
pages and system fonts are installed on your 
computer. You cannot change these settings after 
Setup. 

Regional Settings also defines which international 
settings--such as date, currency, time formats, and 
sort orders for programs your computer will use. 

>>>To change your international settings after Setup:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then 
   click Control Panel. 

2. Double-click Regional Settings. 

3. On the Regional Settings tab, click the down 
   arrow and select a language.

4. To change your number, currency, time and 
   date settings, click the respective tab, and 
   then make your changes.

5. Click OK.

It is recommended that all users, whether 
upgrading over an existing Windows 3.x installation 
or a computer with MS-DOS, verify that their 
Regional Settings have been detected correctly.


UPGRADING FROM THE PAN-EUROPEAN EDITION 
OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95
=======================================

When you are upgrading from the Pan-European 
Edition of Windows 95, the upgrade is performed 
automatically, using the current Regional 
Settings and Keyboard values.


UPGRADING FROM THE U.S. EDITION OF
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95
==================================

When you are upgrading from the U.S. Edition 
of Windows 95, the Computer Settings dialog 
box opens if the following two conditions 
are met: 

1. At least two keyboards installed.
2. Multilanguage Support is installed.

NOTE: If these two conditions are not met, 
the Computer Setting dialog box does not open. 
The existing settings are used and upgraded 
automatically.

If the Computer Settings dialog box opens, 
you may select your respective Regional 
Settings and Keyboard layout. Then the code 
page changes when Setup is complete.


MULTILINGUAL FEATURES IN WINDOWS 98
===================================

You can use Windows 98 to create documents 
in many different languages. For example, 
you can create documents in Central European, 
Cyrillic, Baltic-based languages, Greek, or 
Turkish. After Windows 98 is installed, refer 
to "Multilingual Documents, Creating" in 
Windows online Help for more information.

In Windows 98, you can also load multiple 
keyboard layouts in Windows programs. This 
makes it easy to create multilingual documents. 
To switch between keyboards, press the left 
ALT+SHIFT. For more information, refer to 
"Keyboard, layout" in Windows online Help.
